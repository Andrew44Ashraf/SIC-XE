# SIC-XE

Implemented a valid SIC/XE code generator by Mohamed Nabil. Utilized classical Assembler and SIC/XE code generator 
program  to create a labeled dataset with SIC/XE code and their Object code. 
Implemented decoder-encoder to encode each SIC/XE code to a hidden state then decoded to the object code. 
Stacked Model to train the datasets.
